    <h1>Dihydrogen Monoxide</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Dihydrogen</strong> <strong>Monoxide</strong>, also known as <em>hydroxyl acid</em> or <em>DHMO</em>, is a dangerous substance that 2 is the major component of acid rain,<br>
        contributes to the greenhouse effect,<br>
        may cause severe burns,<br>
        is fatal if inhaled,<br>
        contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape,<br>
        accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals,<br>
        may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes,<br>
        and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite the danger, DHMO is often used:<br>
        as an industrial solvent and coolant,<br>
        in nuclear power plants in the production of Styrofoam<sup>TM</sup>,<br>
        as a fire retardant,<br>
        in many forms of cruel animal research,<br>
        as an additive in certain junk-foods and other food products,<br>
        in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.
    </p>
